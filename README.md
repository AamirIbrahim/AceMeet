Working on an Asexual/Aromantic dating mobile application. 

There is much work to be done, but as this project progresses I hope it will help those individuals who identify as Asexual/Aromantic as well as those who want to know how this type of application is created.

Currently this application will be avaliable for just Android as I do not have a Macbook to create this as well using Swift. I hope to be able to get one as soon as I complete this application so there will be an increased userbase to choose from.

Simple Goals:
1. User Profile
2. Geolocation
3. Matching
4. Chatting
5. Push Notifications
6. Swiping
7. Setting
8. Admin Panel
9. Test for Matching Purposes (Asexual/Aromantic, Heterosexual/Homosexual/Pansexual partner)
10. General UI Changes
